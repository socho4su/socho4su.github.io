										<p>Matthew & Tahseen have been involved in Stuyvesant Student Government in all forms and on all levels.
											<br /><strong>Serving as Caucus & SU Presidents</strong>, we've worked with ambitious students to develop comprehensive projects and wonderful events.
											<br /><strong>Serving on the School Leadership Team (SLT)</strong>, we've been able to work closely with the administration and the parents association to advance school policy changes. Everything from homework policies to Freshmen Out For Frees goes through their legislative committee.
											<br /><strong>Serving on the Manhattan Borough Student Advisory Council</strong>, we've worked with other school leaders, as well as DOE officials to develop proposals and plans for the DOE. These include College Readiness Programs and plans to benefit not only us, but the entire borough as well.

											<h2><a href="plans_communication.html">Communication & Representation</a></h2>
										</header>
										<p>When major policy changes occur, we need to be able to respond quickly with an accurate representation of what the student body wants. We need to keep you in the loop. We've done this for years through websites, emails, mailing lists, hotlines, and calendars. We can't and won't stop that advancement.</p>

										<p>Events promote spirit, unity, and an environment to destress. They also provide the Student Union with funds to continue funding the hundreds of Clubs and Pubs of Stuyvesant. Tens of thousands of dollars of Club Pub funding comes from successful event planning. We're continuing our support for financially stable and progressive events!</p>

										<p>Small improvements in your daily life can be initiated with Student Union task forces that maintain these initiatives. We promise to start emailing out the homeroom and gym schedules every week. We're going to bring together a task force to maintain the schools facilities - an initiative lead by SU SLT Alt. Kevin Boodram & and SU SLT Rep. Asher Lasday.</p>

										</header>
										<p>The Student Union has never really focused on improving the academic life of students of Stuyvesant, but it's time for the SU to step in and work with ARISTA to provide much needed support. We aim to have collaborative study guides made before finals, and we will make sure the homework policy is actually being enforced.</p>

										<p>If Stuyvesant wants to move forward, we need to bring together the force of students that fought for student life improvement in past years. We will bring back the Student's Forum, and we're going to incorporate it into the SU Executive Council.We need to fight student apathy & we're going to work our way up from the freshmen.</p>

										<p>The DOE has full authority over student life in the city. The students barely have a say, if any at all. Our goal is to form a small coalition of leaders from Specialized High Schools to build a force of lobbying power to make sure student voices are echoed throughout the decision making process of the Department of Education.</p>
