											<p>Over the past few years caucuses have gotten progressively more ambitious. These caucuses aim to solve large scale problems including but not limited to academic, tutoring, & policy issues. Having progressive caucuses & progressive students is essential to a strong Student Union. However, not all caucuses and students have access to the networks and resources the Student Union has.

												<br /><br />Matthew & Tahseen have their own initiatives to run & maintain, however this doesnâ€™t mean that the initiatives of caucuses & individuals should be put at a disadvantage to the initiatives of the leaders of the Student Union.

												<br /><br />Thus, the So & Chowdhury campaign is proposing a radical shift in the way the Student Union functions when it comes to policy & daily well-being advancements. If the Student Union believes that the project of a caucus or individual is largely beneficial to the Stuyvesant Community, So & Chowdhury vow to support and provide SU resources to the project.

												<br /><br />Instead of So & Chowdhury leading the work behind the initiative, they will serve as overseers who will guide the caucus or individual in their endeavors. They will be closely informed about all advancements. Through this close work together, leaders can efficiently move their plan forward, and So & Chowdhury can work with them to provide the guidance and tools they need to achieve their goals.</p>

										<strong><p>With this, So & Chowdhury see a Student Union that works constantly with motivated students on multiple projects at any given time. The efficiency and speed by which change occurs would increase dramatically. Accessibility of resources would increase as well, with the bulk of the responsibility to find resources for these task forces & caucuses would fall into the hands of the Student Union.</p></strong>
